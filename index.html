    <p class="highlight">I’m a user experience designer based in San Jose, California. Trained in UX & UI design at UC Berkeley Extension, with a background in graphic and interactive design from Foothill College. I have experience in highly collaborative in-person and remote environments.</p>
    <p>Solving problems and having a positive impact on people’s lives are my true passions. For about 4 years, as a nonprofit program coordinator, I gathered information from stakeholders, funders, and clients in order to conceive and deliver program offerings that generated a measurable impact. My main focus was establishing offerings that were cognizant of the hoops and loops that our clients had to deal with on a daily basis. I was able to develop programming that met people where they were, validated their experience, eliminated access challenges, and integrated services in a seamless way. This approach led to an increase in participation and funding. Shout out to the nonprofit Building Skills Partnership and its amazing team!</p>
    <p>My passion for solving problems is paired with a fierce belief in self-directed learning and life-long education and self-improvement. For the last 2 years, I’ve been learning the importance of visual communication, as well as graphic and typographic principles of design and their value in facilitating conversations and creating a shared understanding. I had the great pleasure to put my graphic design skills to work with real clients at Foothill College. Students, professors, and other faculty members trusted me with their goals for various projects. In return, I created sketches and digital designs that, at times, exceeded their expectations, and at times, generated an open conversation about potential improvements that were stunning growth opportunities.</p>
    <p>But my journey doesn’t end there. Once I came across the UX design methodology my mind was blown! Learning a structured framework to emphasize, define, ideate, prototype, test, and iterate on the creation of products that maximize the benefit for the user and the business was just too fascinating to pass up. </p>
    <p class="highlight">I’m now a UX enthusiast and I’m in it for the long run. I truly look forward to the opportunity to put my passion to the service of a team who has as much drive and appetite for good design as I do. </p>
